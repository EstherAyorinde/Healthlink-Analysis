## Introduction
**HealthLink Analytics** is a healthcare data solutions provider specializing in addressing healthcare disparities by integrating and analyzing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). By combining clinical and socioeconomic data, HealthLink empowers stakeholders to allocate resources more effectively and improve health outcomes, particularly in underserved communities.


## Problem Statement 
HealthLink Analytics faces a significant business challenge in its mission to address healthcare disparities in underserved communities. The company struggles with **Data fragmentation**, as critical datasets such as demographic information and health records remain siloed, preventing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing health outcomes. This was compounded by **Manual data processing**, which introduced inefficiencies and increased the risk of errors, slowing down the delivery of actionable insights. Additionally, the lack of **real-time insights** hindered proactive interventions, delaying responses to emerging health issues. Finally, **geospatial data** gaps limit the ability to analyze and visualize geographic disparities, restricting the targeted allocation of resources. These issues created a barrier to HealthLinkâ€™s goal of improving healthcare delivery and equity, highlighting the need for an integrated, automated solution to analyze and address these disparities.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains patient demographic and socioeconomic data, including:
- Gender, region, and income level  
- Employment status and education distribution  
- Disease type (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS, diabetes)  
- Healthcare access and readmission rates

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Population Overview:**  
  The dataset represents **5,000 individuals** across **7 regions**, with an **average age of 46 years**. The gender distribution is almost equal **50.5% female** and **49.5% male** indicating balanced demographic coverage.

- **Housing Stability:**  
  A large majority (**79.6%**) of the population is *stably housed*, while **20.4%** experience *temporary or overcrowded housing*, highlighting an area that may require policy attention for improved social support.

- **Ethnic Distribution:**  
  The dataset shows diversity in ethnicity, with notable representation across multiple ethnic groups supporting equitable health analysis and inclusion in data driven decision making.

- **Employment and Education:**  
  Most individuals are **employed**, followed by **retired** and **unemployed** groups. A strong portion of the population holds at least **secondary or tertiary education**, suggesting good access to formal education but room for improvement in lifelong learning initiatives.

- **Income and Equity:**  
  Income levels are moderately distributed, with a concentration around the **middle-income category**. Understanding how income influences access to healthcare and stability can guide interventions in lower income areas.

- **Transport and Accessibility:**  
  Accessibility varies by region urban populations report better transport access compared to rural populations. This could affect timely access to healthcare facilities and overall health outcomes.

- **Age Category Distribution:**  
  The population is dominated by **adults**, followed by **elderly** and **youth** groups. This age structure implies that preventive health programs and chronic disease management will be key focus areas for policy planning.

# SDOH Impact and Equilty
This project explores the relationship between social determinants of health (SDOH) and healthcare outcomes across different population groups. Using Power BI, the analysis uncovers patterns in admission and readmission rates, disease prevalence, employment, education, and housing stability. The goal is to help healthcare providers and policymakers identify factors influencing patient outcomes and promote equity in healthcare access.

## Key Insights

- **Employment and Health:** Patients with stable employment had a 65% lower readmission rate compared to unemployed groups.
- **Disease Burden:** Malaria and HIV/AIDS accounted for the highest patient population, highlighting the need for targeted public health interventions.
- **Income and Care Access:** Low income households experienced significantly lower care rates and higher readmission rates.
- **Urban vs Rural Gaps:** Urban populations had better healthcare access and stability compared to rural communities.
- **Education Impact:** Individuals with higher education levels showed stronger health outcomes and stability in housing and employment.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen housing programs to support the 20% facing unstable conditions.  
- Improve rural transport infrastructure to ensure equitable healthcare access.  
- Expand employment and education initiatives to maintain health stability.  
- Tailor healthcare policies for middle aged and elderly populations to manage chronic conditions effectively.  
- Expand outreach programs in rural areas to improve healthcare access.
- Develop employment support initiatives to reduce readmission rates.
- Prioritize education and awareness campaigns on disease prevention.
- Integrate SDOH data into hospital planning for better equity in healthcare delivery.
