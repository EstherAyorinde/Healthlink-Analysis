## Introduction
**HealthLink Analytics** is a healthcare data solutions provider specializing in addressing healthcare disparities by integrating and analyzing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). By combining clinical and socioeconomic data, HealthLink empowers stakeholders to allocate resources more effectively and improve health outcomes, particularly in underserved communities.

## Problem Statement 
HealthLink Analytics faces a significant business challenge in its mission to address healthcare disparities in underserved communities. The company struggles with **Data fragmentation**, as critical datasets such as demographic information and health records remain siloed, preventing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing health outcomes. This was compounded by **Manual data processing**, which introduced inefficiencies and increased the risk of errors, slowing down the delivery of actionable insights. Additionally, the lack of **real-time insights** hindered proactive interventions, delaying responses to emerging health issues. Finally, **geospatial data** gaps limit the ability to analyze and visualize geographic disparities, restricting the targeted allocation of resources. These issues created a barrier to HealthLinkâ€™s goal of improving healthcare delivery and equity, highlighting the need for an integrated, automated solution to analyze and address these disparities.
